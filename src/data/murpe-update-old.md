# murpe Update System

murpe is an update system i had devised in march of 2017 to use in minin productions applications, from the archives i only have evidence of <a href='media.html?page=minin-hub-old'>minin hub</a>, <a href='media.html?page=zebra-pad-old'>zebra pad</a>, and <a href='media.html?page=wheres-the-storage-old'>wts</a> utilizing murpe but there may be more.

i forgot what it stood for soon after i named it but i can only assume it stands for Minin Update Release Platform Environment or something like that. it was hosted on a shady free hosting website

the way it works is there would be php files with the names of the applications, eg. 'zebrapad.php', and then an application would pass a <a class='external' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string'>GET parameter</a> to the php file with the version, eg. '?ver=1.2'. then the page would report if you have the latest version of the program or not, and redirect to the download page for the program.
