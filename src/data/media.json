			"the new look of the website is supposed to look cool, detailed, and hack-ery, all while remaining lightweight and small and i feel like in that aspect i've achieved my goal. and it requires much less code to make responsive and work well on mobile this time around (the unminified css is now 4kb compared to 9.1kb originally!!)",
			"my blog is actually (as of writing) a single json file that is parsed by the user and boom is displayed as either a list of all of the posts or as a post depending on if the ?page get parameter is passed to media.html, i feel like this is alright for now cause i want it to be fun to update my blog and not a chore to compile static pages - which i am debating on doing if i can automate it well enough with my limited skillset :p"],

			"groinfrick was a project i started back in december of 2017, and i had either finished it then or on the june of 2018. either way back then i was much less experienced in javascript and i would say i had a much worse coding style but honestly it wasn't that bad (for my standards at least, lol)",
			"the intention of the project was (originally) to write an extended version of <a class='external' href='https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck'>brainfuck</a>, i didn't think it was that important to be backwards compatable or something so i wrote the original eight commands in a way that breaks compatability - i also didn't fully grasp ascii at that time and i wrote my own \"type systen\" for groinfrick (needless to say this also broke backwards compatability)",
			"i decided to rewrite groinfrick on the march of 2020 with my better understanding of javascripts and other fundamental concepts. firstly, i rewrote the specs to implement the core brainfuck components first and add a set of extended components (that matched my old specification) after. once i finally got the brainfuck compatability to work it was a cakewalk to add the remaining extended functions, some of which exist for debugging and i have already added during the first phase...",
			"honestly, im not that good of a brainfuck programmer so i struggled to write any examples by myself for groinfrick, and really i can't see that much of a use for the extra loops and return functions i added but hey - it's all about the journey, not the destination, and boy am i proud of this project."],
