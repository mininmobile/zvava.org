Minin Productions was the name of a "company" that i had founded in 2015 (maybe 2014 but i don't have any archives) to list all or most of my projects under which i didn't feel like associating with myself personally for some reason.

it was renamed from 'Minin Inc.' sometime around 2016 or 2017 as i had several "brands" like Minin Arts and MininMusic for my creative outlets and i wanted to unify them all since they were seperate for no good reason.
