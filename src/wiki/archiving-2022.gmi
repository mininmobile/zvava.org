i previously[1] went and archived a bunch of past projects to this website, the only problem was that a lot of this content was hosted externally on either mega, youtube, or soundcloud. now, all the content is available locally off *my* web server and doesn't rely on 3rd parties

the content affected by this are ðŸ’¾ software, ðŸŽµ music, and ðŸ“º video posts

until i am able to set up my own git server all my code will remain hosted on github, though :l
