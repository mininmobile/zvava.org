zvava, my current alias, is actually a rot13 of my previous alias minin. i came up with minin when i was 7 years old and coming up with a name for my minecraft youtube channel, so what'd be better name for a minecraft youtuber then the word mining but without the g? (pronounced like minin') inbetween zvava and minin was 'minin gamer' which actually came first but i knocked off the gamer some time later.
