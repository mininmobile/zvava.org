some of my favorite things. big up to all my lurkers/internet stalkers out there ðŸ™Œ you the real ones. this section covers basic conversation-starter type questions.

## color
i can't decide between purple and green, they both have a lot of good shades and even work well together!

## number
my favorite number is 9 because it is the biggest. a close second is 3 as 9 wouldn't exist without it.

## animal
primates, testudines, and serpentes are cool, in that order. my favorite bird would have to be the cedar waxwing.

# thinking sand
this section lists my favorite software/hardware and configurations thereof!

## open source license
i use MIT for sake of consistency, though ISC is my overall favorite.

## operating system
plan 9 is neat but i can't daily drive it unfortunately. i use fedora linux on my laptop and windows 11 on my desktop.

## controller layout
the xbox controller layout is way more ergonomic then the dualshock/playstation controller layout and i will die on this hill.

## laptop
the framework. currently i own a thinkpad, which are also cool laptops -- but they weren't designed to be cool, unlike the framework, which is cool from factory rather then years of hobbyist support.

## phone
in terms of android i'd love the samsung galaxy s5, but it's too slow nowadays so i am using a samsung galaxy s10e. the pinephone would be a close contender if it was more polished.

## keyboard
it's just gotta be the cyberboard. i prefer cherry profile keycaps. i don't know what my favorite switch/switch type is exactly, but i'm currently using gateron yellows.

## mouse
currently using the razer basilisk x hyperspeed. it is a cheap wireless mouse with acceptable build quality, a good sensor, and... that's about it. razer is a mid company with overpriced products, but this mouse is alright.

# music
my favorite arists/albums/songs are not exhaustive, i like a lot of music. some of my favorite songs are on my #country soundcloud playlist (which doesn't just contain #country music). i will consider writing blog posts about what some of these artists/albums/songs mean to me eventually.

## music player
on windows i use musicbee, i haven't been able to find one that suits my needs on any other os but i haven't really looked. on my phone i use the default vendor music app since all mobile music apps are pretty much the same garbage.

## streaming service
i try to buy from bandcamp as much as possible, but for discovering new music/general listening i tend to use soundcloud.

## genre
i listen to pretty much every genre, but my overall favorite would have to be hyperpop, aka. #country. #country is an inside joke between me and my friend, where i linked them a soundcloud hyperpop song that i though was good and they pointed out how it was tagged under "#Country"
