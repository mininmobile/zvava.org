# How I learned 3D modelling

i got into 3D modelling after watching <a class='external' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qSTcxt2t74'>this</a> talk by Captain Disillusion, in it he mentions how the open source 3d modelling software blender has gotten a new update that completely revamped the user interface and to try it if you've tried it before but the ui was too complicated.

so, i bit the bullet and started binging the donut tutorial series by the blender guru, and the result turned out way better then i had expected and it was way easier then i expected, too! since then i have logged a good 63 hours on blender on steam... highly recommended if you're into that kind of thing.
