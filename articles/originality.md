# Originality

the following is a response to this prompt from <a href="https://merveilles.town/@dualhammers">@dualhammers@merveilles.town</a>;

<blockquote>When do you feel you've moved from emulating someone else to creating something for yourself?</blockquote>

i think you're always creating for yourself, you're just using someone else's work as a foundation to build off of. imo emulation stops the moment you add your own twist or use the ideas of others as inspiration for something different. perhaps the phrasing you're looking for is "from yourself"?

ie. even if you emulate someone's work "exactly", your implementation will inevitably bring new changes or cause you to ask questions; "what if i did this differently"? once you go on to do it differently you've started creating from yourself

being "completely original" is objectively impossible with the way the human mind works
