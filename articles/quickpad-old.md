# Quickpad

quickpad is a notepad application made in <a href="/media/pika-software-builder'>pika software builder</a> as a precursor to <a href='media.html?page=zebra-pad-old.html">zebra pad</a>. it was an application where you could quickly jot down notes and save them quickly and easily.

but really, it was supposed to be a full notepad application until i ran into the limitations of pika and had to compromise and then i acted like that was how i meant it to be all along.

it featured one whole textbox and one dropdown in the menu bar which was 'File', the only option it contained was 'Save' which would create/overwrite a file on your desktop called 'quickpaddocument.txt' with the contents of the textbox.
