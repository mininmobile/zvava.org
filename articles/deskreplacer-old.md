# Desktop Replacer

deskreplacer/desktop replacer was a utility i made with <a href='media.html?page=pika-software-builder'>pika software builder</a> with the purpose of replacing the default windows desktop with an idiot proof and simplified version.

the only archived version, 1.5, features a link to a google chrome shortcut and a link to a bundled version of <a href='media.html?page=fxweb-old'>fxweb</a> 2.2 on the desktop under the text "welcome". in the top right corner was a close button and in the bottom right was a theme selector button which let you choose a different wallpaper

i remember that in earlier versions i instead bundled fxweb minimal which is still in the folder instead of full 2.2, the minimal version of fxweb was actually created specifically for deskreplacer
