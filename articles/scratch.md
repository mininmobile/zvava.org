# Scratch

scratch is a functional, visual programming language that uses blocks to build projects, it is targetting primarily towards children.

scratch was the first programming language i have ever learned. i started when i was signed up to the <a class='external' href='https://coderdojo.com/'>coderdojo</a> in athlone and since then i've become a complete nerd. thanks mom.

really though, it has thought me the fundamentals on programming and from there on i learned <a href="/media/batch.html">batch</a> which thought me even more. somewhere inbetween there i learned html and css and thus javascript (plus some others) which brings me to where i am today!
