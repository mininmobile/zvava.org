# Where's The Storage?

where's the storage (better written as wts, a play on wtf) started off as a <a class='external' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO_gqbE3e54'>hard drive activity light</a> but i had expanded it into a ccleaner clone. it was written in C#.net winforms and utilized <a href='media.html?page=murpe-update-old'>murpe</a> for updates

after the tutorial i added a ui which could scan and list locations on your computer which contain junk data and could also run a batch file which cleared out junk data in those locations.

i think this idea could have gone places, and i was indeed working on a whole revamp but soon after i forgot about the project, email me if you would like me to publish the source code anywhere if you're curious
