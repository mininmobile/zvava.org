# Batch

batch (.bat or .cmd) files are lists of ms dos commands with added branching via if, for, and goto statements. it is <a class='external' href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11126539/is-batch-turing-complete'>turing complete</a> so i will refer to it as a programming language

batch was my second programming language to <a href='media.html?page=scratch'>scratch</a> and it thought me a lot about more conventional (non-gui) programming in my earlier years, sometimes i still write projects in it for the hell of it cause it's actually quite fun to write in.
