# Poop Replacement Therapy

i made this render in blender and added some cool dashed lines in paint.net afterwards. this and "ball" were the only two pieces i made in this style but i think they both turned out pretty well. this also began my journey of posting funky abstract pieces.

this was also supposed to be album art but, lets be honest, i'll probably never finish the album

"making some experimental album called poop replacement therapy, probably will complete it more then half way through the year if i remember lol. i suck at long term projects especially when a lot of school work is in the way."
