# Minin Hub

minin hub was a web browser except it is only able to access the minin productions homepage. (now defunct) it was my first application to use <a href="/media/murpe-update-old.html">murpe</a> for updates

back in the good old days of having my head far up my own ass i thought that people would download a program made specifically to view my website - not even offline or anything. but i mean i never tried to catch traction for any of my things i just did it for fun and i guess that's what everything should be about, right?
