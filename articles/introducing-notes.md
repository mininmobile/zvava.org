# Introducing Notes

i have added an additional section to this website where i will share some 'notes' which don't fit into the blog format and act more as wiki pages. i use these pages to deliver information that i may update sometime in the future, for example a list of books i've read. it has it's own spot below the blog on the front page of the website showing the last modified page.
