# zvava.org
static website generator (html and gemini) for my personal website

## development
run `qjs ./make.js` to create out/, out/gemini/, and out/www/, then generate contents

run `webserver 80 out/www/` (`npm i -g webserver`) to debug html output

run `agate --content out/gemini/ --host localhost` to debug gemini output

## production
make sure all changes are committed and pushed

run `publish.bat` on windows or `publish.sh` on unix and enter password to sync changes with the webserver

remote server will fetch the latest version of this repo, and run the publish.sh script. this builds the site remotely and copies `out/gemini/` to `/var/gemini/content/` and `out/www/` to `/var/www/`
